This project has series of notebooks and codes, that I have completed and implemented while attending the course ["Udemy The Data Science Course 2019: Complete Data Science Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).

## Code Requirements
The example notebooks and codes are in python 3.6 with virtual environment along with packages as listed in requirement.txt

## Description

Its a Complete Data Science Training: Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistics in Python, Machine & Deep Learning.

## Course Overview

The Problem
Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.
However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.And how can you do that?Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)
Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture.

The Solution
Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.
Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning  
Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.
